									<h1>Implementation Risk Assessment Scorecard</h1>
    <p class="article-meta">By ClearWay Projects &bull; July 10, 2025</p>
  </header>

									<p>
    Successful SaaS implementations rarely happen by accident. This scorecard helps you quickly assess your organization’s biggest delivery risks—so you can act before they become costly setbacks.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Use This Scorecard</h2>
  <p>
    For each area below, rate your current implementation approach on a scale of 1 (high risk) to 5 (low risk). Be honest—this is for your own clarity, not for show. Add up your scores to see where you’re strong and where you need to focus.
  </p>

    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Category</th>

        <td><strong>Leadership & Authority</strong></td>
        <td>
          Is there a dedicated project manager? Is your project team empowered to make decisions on scope, budget, and configuration? Is the executive sponsor engaged and involved?

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Urgency & Planning</strong></td>
        <td>
          Is any pre-work necessary? Do you have a defined target rollout date? Is there a compelling event motivating the team to stay on track? Will this project take priority over other job duties?

      <tr>
        <td><strong>User Adoption & Change Management</strong></td>

  <h2>Score Interpretation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>35–40:</strong> Low risk — You’re set up for success. Keep reinforcing your strengths.</li>
    <li><strong>25–34:</strong> Moderate risk — Some gaps to address. Focus on your lowest scores first.</li>
    <li><strong>Below 25:</strong> High risk — Implementation is likely at risk for delays, rework, or missed outcomes. Prioritize improvements now.</li>
  </ul>
