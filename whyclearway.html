										<h1>Why ClearWay Projects?</h1>
										<h2>Implementation Success, Without the Guesswork</h2>
									</header>

									

									<p>oftware implementations fail for predictable reasons—unclear expectations, misaligned stakeholders, unrealistic timelines, and inadequate planning. Yet most organizations approach each implementation as if they're solving a brand-new problem, rather than applying proven frameworks that eliminate common pitfalls.</p>
									<p>ClearWay Projects bridges that gap. We combine real-world implementation experience with proven delivery frameworks to help your team scale faster, onboard smarter, and deliver more consistently. Whether you're refining a growing practice or preparing for rapid growth, we help you lay the groundwork for success.</p>
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p><strong>Structured but Pragmatic</strong> - We believe in frameworks that actually work in the real world, not theoretical models that look good on paper but break down under pressure.<br />
<strong>Momentum-Focused</strong> - Every engagement is designed to build forward progress, not create more meetings or documentation that sits unused.<br />
<strong>Results-Driven</strong> - We measure success by outcomes that matter to your business: faster implementations, higher adoption rates, reduced churn, and predictable delivery timelines.</p>
<h3>Who We Partner With</h3>
<strong>Software Vendors</strong> whose customer success teams need guidance on developing scalable onboarding processes and implementation practices that grow with their business.<br />
<strong>Software Buyers</strong> who don't have the internal expertise or bandwidth to ensure their new software investment delivers the promised ROI.<br />
<strong>Business Leaders</strong> who need senior-level guidance to lead complex software implementations, transform delivery teams, or bring clarity to mission-critical internal initiatives.</p>
<h2>The ClearWay Difference</h2>
<p>Most consulting approaches either provide generic best practices that don't fit your specific situation, or custom solutions that are too complex to sustain. We focus on the middle ground: proven methodologies that can be adapted to your unique context and maintained by your team long after our engagement ends.</p>
<p>Whether you're building a new customer onboarding experience, revamping internal processes, or struggling to make expensive software stick, we provide the senior-level expertise to move things forward—with confidence, clarity, and measurable progress.</p>

      <p>
        I bring 20+ years of experience transforming SaaS delivery organizations and leading complex implementations. My track record includes increasing delivery revenue by 77% while reducing costs, building unified PMOs across multiple geographies, and maintaining 90%+ client retention rates.</p>
<p>Most recently, I served as VP of Professional Services at Contract Logix, where I transformed their delivery capabilities and achieved dramatic revenue growth. Before that, I spent over two decades at Upland Software building and managing PMOs that united teams across multiple functions and geographies.</p>
<p>I founded ClearWay Projects to bring this senior-level expertise directly to organizations that need guidance but don't require a full-time executive. Whether you're scaling delivery capabilities or ensuring your software investment pays off, I provide the experience to move things forward with confidence.    </p>
